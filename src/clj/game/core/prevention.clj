;; DOCUMENTATION FOR THE PREVENTION SYSTEM
;;   Interrupts/prevention abilities in the CR are awkward, because:
;;   1) despite ncigs going, still have to obey ncigs (have to be relevant to the interrupt)
;;   2) may be a mix of triggered events, static abilities, and paid abilities
;;   3) Static abilities *should* be triggered first, but paid abilities and triggered events
;;        may be resolved in any order
;;   4) Some effects interact with paid abilities, so we need to ensure we differentiate between
;;        paid abilities and events
;;   5) Some of these may be floating effects from cards that are no longer in play (see leverage)
;;   6) Some effects may only be used a limited number of times, some are repeatable (see prana)
;;
;; Sow how does this system work?
;;   * Cards may have a :prevention list in their cdef
;;   * This is a list of all prevention abilities on the card
;;   * A prevention ability looks like this:
;;
;;   :prevention [{:prevents :tag
;;                 :type :ability
;;                 :prompt "Trash Decoy to avoid 1 tag?"
;;                 :ability {:async true
;;                           :cost [(->c :trash-can)]
;;                           :msg "avoid 1 tag"
;;                           :req (req (and (pos? (:remaining context))
;;                                          (not (:unpreventable context))))
;;                           :effect (req (prevent-tag state :runner eid 1))}}]})
;;
;;  KEYS:
;;    :prevents - key, what this prevention is for (ie :tag, :damage, :pre-damage, :jack-out)
;;    :type     - either :ability, or :event, for if this is a paid ability or a triggered event
;;    :prompt   - string - optional - a prompt to be displayed when you click the button
;;                if this isn't supplied, it will instead jump straight into the ability resolution
;;                otherwise, it will be an `:optional {:prompt prompt :yes-ability ability}`
;;    :label    - stribng - optional - the label for the button. If not supplied, it will just be the
;;                name of the card (ie "Decoy"). I recommend only using this for handlers that
;;                have ambiguity (ie feedback filter, dummy box, caldera, zaibatsu loyalty) as a way
;;                of adding additional contextual information for the user.
;;    :max-uses - int - optional - is there a maximum number of times this ability can trigger in one
;;                instance? See: prana, muresh, cleaners, etc. If blank,
;;                then this ability can be used any number of times so long as the req fn allows it
;;    :ability  - the ability that gets triggered when you chose the prevention.
;;                Write it like any other ability. It will hav access to a context map which
;;                will typically have:
;;                1) :remaining     - either numeric, or sequential, depending on prevention type
;;                2) :count         - initial quantity of the thing to prevent (numeric)
;;                3) :prevented     - either a numeric count, or the :all key for everything
;;                4) :source-player - which player initiated this event (ie who did damage)
;;                5) :source-card   - which card initiated this event (ie scorched earth)
;;                6) :unpreventable - sometimes true, is this unpreventable?
;;                7) :unboostable   - almost never true, is this unboostable?
;;
;;  FLOATING PREVENTIONS:
;;    * register a lingering effect of :type :prevention
;;    * :req should enforce the side - ie `:req (req (= :runner side))`
;;    * :value is just a prevention map like normal
;;    * in the :ability map, add `:condition :floating` so the engine will let us actually fire the
;;        ability
;;
;;  Note: The `:req` fn of the given :ability is used for computing if the button should
;;        show up, as well as wether or not you can pay the cost.
